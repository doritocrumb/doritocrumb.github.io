			<p>In late 2015, the songs "Thom" and "you suck charlie" were leaked onto the internet and prompted Miller, in January 2016, to publicly announce his discontent 
			on a post on Instagram. Miller mentioned that the purpose of the "unknown account" that contained these songs was for the enjoyment of him and his friends. 
			He intended to keep the music a secret from his fanbase as they mainly focused on his comedic music. However, when the account in question was discovered and its 
			music was reuploaded to platforms like YouTube, he felt he had no control over his "own image or identity" and decided to continue his music career under his original 
			stage name. In addition, he linked his Joji SoundCloud account and also announced that he would be releasing a full-length commercial project titled Chloe Burbank: 
			Volume 1 with "Thom" and "you suck charlie" serving as singles. After this, he started to upload more songs onto his SoundCloud.</p> 
			<p>After the release of his album Pink Season under the Pink Guy persona, which debuted atop the iTunes charts and at number 70 on the Billboard 200, he sat down in 
			an interview with Pigeons and Planes and mentioned the reason he has kept using the different pseudonyms saying, “I was doing music way before the Filthy Frank stuff, 
			I've always wanted to make normal music. I just started the YouTube channel to kind of bump my music. But then Filthy Frank and the Pink Guy stuff ended up getting way
			bigger than I thought so I had to kind of roll with it.”</p> 
			<p>In December 2016 and January 2017, songs under Joji started to be uploaded onto the 88rising channel, indicating a partnership between Miller and 88rising on future 
			projects. In mid-2017, he released "i dont wanna waste my time" and "rain on me" onto his SoundCloud and on the 88rising channel. In an interview, Miller 
			noted that he had been "making beats and working on a few big projects" and hinted at a full-length Joji project being released.</p>
