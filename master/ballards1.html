			<p>Ballads 1 is primarily produced by Joji himself and features only one vocal feature, with Trippie Redd appearing on "R.I.P." though features production features 
			from names such as Clams Casino, D33J and Shlohmo. The project is introspective, writing about the "reality of love, life and everything in between." The project 
			ranges from songs that are "heart-wretching" and sometimes more cheerful to capture the feeling that "no one's sad all the time". The focus of the project is ballads, 
			according to Joji; and in an interview with Annie Mac said that he was trying to make the project full of ballads that are different in their "own special way" 
			and that are powerful, set a new direction but keep "Joji roots" he established on In Tongues. Joji stated in an interview with Triple J how he wanted to take a 
			more pop-oriented approach to his style on the album, which began with the single "Yeah Right".</p>
			<p>Ballads 1 was announced on 12 September 2018 alongside the release of the album's second single "Slow Dancing in the Dark". An accompanying music video directed 
			by Jared Hogan was released the same day. The lead single, "Yeah Right" had been released on 8 May 2018. It was released with a music video and was produced by 
			Joji. "Can't Get Over You" was released on 2 October 2018 with an accompanying video directed by Miller and SAINT. The album's release date, cover artwork and 
			track listing were revealed the same day. "Test Drive" was released on 16 October 2018 with an accompanying video directed by James Defina. A music video for 
			"Wanted U" was released on 29 October 2018, directed by Michael La Burt.</p>
