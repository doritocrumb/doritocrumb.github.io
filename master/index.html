			<p class="left">George Miller, better known by his stage name Joji and formerly by his online aliases Filthy Frank and Pink Guy, is a Japanese singer, songwriter, 
			comedian, and a former Internet personality and YouTuber.</p>
			<p class="left">Miller began his career as  an entertainer through his many now-defunct YouTube channels, the most popular one being TVFilthyFrank. 
			They consisted of rap songs, swearing, rants,  extreme challenges, ukulele performances, and a shock humor show titled The Filthy Frank Show, with most 
			of the main characters played by Miller,  including the titular character of Filthy Frank. To complement his TVFilthyFrank channel, Miller produced comedy 
			hip hop music under his Pink Guy alias, who is also a zentai-wearing recurring character on The Filthy Frank Show, with his songs featured on the show and 
			his discography spanning two full-length projects and an extended play. Miller's videos had widespread impact, including starting a viral dance craze known 
			as the Harlem Shake, which was directly responsible for the debut of Baauer's "Harlem Shake" song atop the Billboard Hot 100. Many YouTube personalities made 
			major or cameo appearances on The Filthy Frank Show, including h3h3Productions, iDubbbz, JonTron, Michael Stevens, and PewDiePie.</p>
			<p class="left">In December 2017, Miller stated he had retired the channel to focus on his music career, under the name Joji, producing more nuanced and serious music, 
			releasing the EP In Tongues, which peaked at number 58 on the Billboard 200, and his debut studio album Ballads 1, which reached number 1 on Billboard's 
			Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums in November 2018. With this, Miller became the first Asian-born artist to do so. Miller's music has been described as a mix between 
			R&B, lo-fi and trip hop.</p><br><br>
